                    <p class="ari-text"> Born in Kingston, Canada, Millen became serious about pursuing acting in his senior year of high school and went on to receive training at Ryerson University. After graduation, he began with small roles on Regenesis, Nikita, Rookie Blue and Played and was featured in the 100-person art project that was the subject of Ryan Hughes short film, Makeout.  Ari plays a number of male clones (see here) â€“ the result of a sister project to Project Leda: Project Castor, a top-secret military program. Unlike their Leda counterparts, the Castor clones have always been aware of what they are, being raised together by the US military. The first Castor clone to be introduced to the viewers is Mark Rollins, coming off as a homicidal Prolethean, before being exposed as an undercover Castor agent.</p>
